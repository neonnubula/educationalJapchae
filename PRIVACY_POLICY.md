## Privacy Policy for Most Important Thing

_Last updated: 2025-06-24_

Thank you for choosing **Most Important Thing** (“the App”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you may provide while using the App.

### 1. Overview
Most Important Thing is an offline-first goal-tracking application. All information you enter (e.g., your daily goals, multi-day goals, settings) is **stored locally on your device only**. We do **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data with our servers or third-party services.

### 2. Information We Collect
The App does **not** collect any personally identifiable information. Specifically:

* **Goals & History** – Saved locally via on-device encrypted storage (Hive database).
* **Notification Preferences** – Stored locally to schedule reminders.

The App does not use analytics SDKs, advertising identifiers, or location services.

### 3. How We Use Information
Locally stored information is used solely to:

1. Display your goals and history inside the App.
2. Schedule local notifications reminding you of your selected goals.

### 4. Data Storage & Security
Data is stored using Hive, an encrypted key-value database that resides on your device. We employ industry-standard encryption provided by the operating system. Because data never leaves your device, risks of interception are minimized.

### 5. Data Sharing & Third-Party Access
We do **not** share, sell, or transmit your information to third parties. The App operates entirely offline except when the operating system delivers local notifications.

### 6. Children's Privacy
The App is not directed at children under 13. We collect no data that could identify a child. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data, please contact us; we will promptly delete such data from the device when requested.

### 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as the App evolves (e.g., upcoming cloud backup or social features). Any changes will be posted here, and the "Last updated" date will be revised. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the new policy.

### 8. Contact Us
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please email **privacy@mostimportantthing.app**.

By using Most Important Thing, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
